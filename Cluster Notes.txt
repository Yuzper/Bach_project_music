Look into VPN for access cluster at home
If you can access http://hpc.itu.dk/ you have internet access.

ssh jete@hpc.itu.dk

make folder for project
git clone repository


squeue (s stands for slur)

scancel, will cancel a job

Copy file from local computer to cluster
scp [Source] [Target]
Target = jete@hpc.itu.dk:./filename

Notes Group Meeting:

Baseline fellow students, give the knowledge to understand the thesis.

Explain it is valid since it is not covered in related work or partly covered.

Do analysis/approach first, lastly the basics, intro etc.

Method, features, model, training etc.

Evaluation chapter, 

Conclusion, what is my contribution / what I learned in the process.

Related Work:
Different paramides / family of methods will have different subsections.

Have a brief section at the beginning of the section and details later in the section.
Okay to steal a figure if it is referenced.



Explain:
 - Transformers
 - BERT
 - MusicBERT

Not as much explaination on CNN and RNN.
Explain the combined approach in CRNN.
